## File Encryption/Decryption Script

This Python script encrypts and decrypts files using XOR encryption. It offers a simple menu interface:

- **Encrypt**: Secures a file with an integer encryption key.
- **Decrypt**: Restores an encrypted file using the same key.
- **Exit**: Quits the program.

**Note**: XOR encryption used here is not secure for sensitive data. This script is intended for educational purposes and should not be used for real-world encryption needs.
